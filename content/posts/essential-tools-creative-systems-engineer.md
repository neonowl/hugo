When I told people that I was getting my Master’s Degree in Systems Engineering (2021-2023), their response was along the lines of “Oh. Computers...”

Being a systems engineer isn't all about writing requirements, analyzing alternatives, estimating cost and risk, and testing & evaluating systems throughout all stages of their lifecycle. Creative problem-solving and clear communication are equally important!

Here's a list of essential tools to add a dash of creativity to your engineering toolkit, all free and open-source.

## Graphics Manipulation
For editing photos, creating mockups, or designing visual aids, look no further than [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). Think of it as the open-source cousin of Photoshop, offering a powerful and versatile suite of image editing tools.

## Video Editing
Transform raw footage into polished presentations or explainer videos with [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/). This user-friendly editor supports a wide range of formats and allows you to add effects, transitions, and text for a professional touch.

## Audio Editing
Need to edit sound effects, create voice overs, or analyze audio data? [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) is your one-stop shop. This intuitive software lets you record, edit, and export audio files in various formats, making it perfect for adding sound to your projects.

## Embrace Your Inner Artist
If traditional image editing feels limiting, unleash your artistic side with [Krita](https://krita.org). This digital painting program boasts a wide brush library, customizable settings, and a canvas that can handle even the most ambitious projects.

## Vector Power
For crafting technical diagrams, flowcharts, or scalable icons, [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is your power-up. This vector graphics editor lets you create professional-looking illustrations that can be resized without losing quality, perfect for presentations or documentation.

These open-source tools offer a powerful and cost-effective way to add creativity and clarity to your work as a systems engineer.
